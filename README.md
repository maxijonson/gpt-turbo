## About

> Are you a dev looking for the library? [Click here](./packages/lib/)!

GPT Turbo is a JavaScript library for seamless integration with OpenAI's Chat Completion API. It ensures smooth conversation continuity and message history tracking, perfect for creating conversational AI applications.

## Features

> ‚ú® New (June 2023): Added support for **Function calling**! Try it out in the web app [here](https://gpt-turbo-web.chintristan.io/functions/create).

ü§ñ Supports all Chat Completion models, including **GPT-4**. (full list [here](https://platform.openai.com/docs/models/model-endpoint-compatibility))

üí¨ Supports both single, streamed and function completions, just like ChatGPT.

‚öô Tune chat completion parameters, such as temperature, top-p, and frequency penalty.

üåê Compatible in both Node.js and the browser.

üìú Keeps track of the conversation history for you, making conversation continuity a breeze.

üí∞ Estimate the cost and size of conversations before sending them to the API. (*through a plugin*)

üíæ Easily persist conversations with serialization and deserialization methods.

üîå Includes a plugin system for extending the library's functionality.

üíª Built entirely with TypeScript.

‚öîÔ∏è Battle-tested in multiple environments. (See [implementations](#implementations))

## Implementations

This repo is a mono-repo containing both the [Library](./packages/lib/) and small projects powered by it. Here's a list of all the projects that were built with the GPT Turbo [Library](./packages/lib/)

- [Web](./packages/implementations/web/): A web app, very similar to ChatGPT, for handling chats in the browser.
- [Discord](./packages/implementations/discord/): A Discord bot for chatting in Discord servers, similar to Discord's own Clyde AI bot.
- [CLI](./packages/implementations/cli/): A command-line interface to chat straight from your terminal.
- [Nest](./packages/implementations/nest/): A NestJS backend, for interacting with the library via a REST API.
