title: Authoring Conversation Plugins
description: Create your own conversation plugins for project use or to publish on NPM.

Creating plugins can help you (or others) extend the functionnality of a conversation.
Plugins can tap into the conversation lifecycle at various moments to perform actions such as:

-   Calculating usage stats on the conversation (which is done by the [`gpt-turbo-plugin-stats`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/gpt-turbo-plugin-stats) plugin)
-   Modifying user prompts before they're sent to the API
-   Reacting to message moderation results
-   Automate prompt generation

## Creating a plugin

Plugins are functions that receive two arguments:

-   `properties`: every conversation properties (including private ones) and the conversation itself.
-   `pluginData`: an optional argument that can be used to retrieve data from the plugin's previous execution. (usually when deserializing a conversation from JSON)
    -   If you're planning on using this argument, your plugin definition should define the `getPluginData` property as a function that returns the `pluginData` to be retrieved later.

This function returns a plugin definition, which is an object with optional properties you can define to tap into the conversation lifecycle

For convenience, GPT Turbo provides a `createConversationPlugin` function to help you write type-safe plugins.

```ts
import { createConversationPlugin } from "gpt-turbo";

export const myPluginName = "my-plugin";

const myPlugin = createConversationPlugin(
    myPluginName,
    (properties, pluginData) => {
        const { conversation, history /* ... */ } = properties;
        return {
            // Plugin Definition Properties
        };
    }
);
```

## Plugin Definition Properties

Here are all the properties that you can define for your plugin definition.
All of them are optional, just define the ones you need.

### onPostInit

Called after all plugins have been initialized.
This could potentially be used to interop with other plugins.

**Receives**: Nothing

**Returns**: Nothing

### transformConversationJson

Called when a `Conversation` is being transformed into JSON (`conversation.toJSON()`).

**Receives**:
- `json`: the JSON object that will be returned by `conversation.toJSON()`

**Returns**: a valid JSON object for the conversation (`ConversationModel`).

### transformConversationCallableFunctionsJson

Called when a `ConversationCallableFunctions` is being transformed into JSON (`conversation.callableFunctions.toJSON()`).

**Receives**:
- `json`: the JSON object that will be returned by `conversation.callableFunctions.toJSON()`

**Returns**: a valid JSON object for the conversation callable functions (`ConversationCallableFunctionsModel`).

### transformConversationConfigJson

Called when a `ConversationConfig` is being transformed into JSON (`conversation.config.toJSON()`).

**Receives**:
- `json`: the JSON object that will be returned by `conversation.config.toJSON()`

**Returns**: a valid JSON object for the conversation config (`ConversationConfigModel`).

### transformConversationHistoryJson

Called when a `ConversationHistory` is being transformed into JSON (`conversation.history.toJSON()`).

**Receives**:
- `json`: the JSON object that will be returned by `conversation.history.toJSON()`

**Returns**: a valid JSON object for the conversation history (`ConversationHistoryModel`).

### transformConversationRequestOptionsJson

Called when a `ConversationRequestOptions` is being transformed into JSON (`conversation.requestOptions.toJSON()`).

**Receives**:
- `json`: the JSON object that will be returned by `conversation.requestOptions.toJSON()`

**Returns**: a valid JSON object for the conversation request options (`ConversationRequestOptionsModel`).

### onUserPrompt

Tap into a user message instance created during prompt.

*can be async.*

**Receives**:
- `message`: The user `Message` instance.

**Returns**: Nothing

### onUserPromptError

Called when an error is thrown during a user prompt.
This can be useful to clean up your plugin's state.

> Errors thrown during this method will have no effect.
> This is to ensure all plugins implementing this method are called.

*can be async.*

**Receives**:
- `error`: The error that was thrown.

**Returns**: Nothing

### onChatCompletion

Tap into an assistant message instance during a chat completion **before** it is added to the history.

> Keep in mind that the message passed to this method is not necessarily a standard chat completion. 
> It could be a function call too.
> Additionnaly, the message could be streamed or not, so message content may not yet be available when this method is called.

*can be async.*

**Receives**:
- `message`: The assistant `Message` instance.

**Returns**: Nothing

### transformFunctionResult

Transform the function prompt result before it is stringified.

*can be async.*

**Receives**:
- `result`: The result of the function generated by the client code

**Returns**: The new result. 
Keep in mind this result is later stringified (using `JSON.stringify`). 
That being said, your result **must be serializable**.

### onFunctionPrompt

Tap into a function message instance.

*can be async.*

**Receives**:
- `prompt`: The function `Message` instance.

### onFunctionPromptError

Called when an error is thrown during a function prompt.
This can be useful to clean up your plugin's state.

> Errors thrown during this method will have no effect.
> This is to ensure all plugins implementing this method are called.

*can be async.*

**Receives**:
- `error`: The error that was thrown.

**Returns**: Nothing

### onModeration

Tap into a message that was moderated.

*can be async.*

**Receives**:
- `message`: The moderated `Message` instance, with the `flags` property populated.

**Returns**: Nothing

### getPluginData

Allows your plugin to store data in the `pluginsData` property of the `ConversationModel` returned by the `Conversation.toJSON` method.
This data will be stored under the name of your plugin and will be accessible when your plugin is initialized. (second argument of the plugin function)

> This data **must** be serializable, as it is stored during the serialization of the conversation to JSON.
> Storing a non-serializable value will have unexpected results.

**Receives**: Nothing

**Returns**: The data to be stored in the `pluginsData` property of the `ConversationModel` returned by the `Conversation.toJSON` method.

### out

The output of the plugin.
This is useful for plugins that want to expose some functionality to client code.
This output can be virtually anything, such as a class instance, a function, or a primitive value.
Typically, client code would access the output of a plugin like this:

```ts
const myPlugin = conversation.getPlugin("myPlugin");
const myPluginOutput = myPlugin.out;

// or

const myPluginOutput = conversation.getPluginOutput("myPlugin");
```

## Guidelines

If you're planning on plublishing your plugin on NPM, you should follow these recommendations, although they're not required.
You can view an example source code for an homemade plugin, [`gpt-turbo-plugin-stats`](https://github.com/maxijonson/gpt-turbo/blob/develop/packages/plugins/gpt-turbo-plugin-stats/src/index.ts), for reference.

-   **Strongly recommended** to add the `gpt-turbo-plugin` keyword to your `package.json` file. Users can then [search NPM for packages with this keyword](https://www.npmjs.com/search?q=keywords:gpt-turbo-plugin) to find your plugin.
-   Name your package with the `gpt-turbo-plugin-` prefix (e.g: `gpt-turbo-plugin-stats`).
-   Export your plugin name as a constant.

    ```ts
    export const myPluginName = "my-plugin";
    ```

-   Write your plugin in TypeScript so that the library can infer some types off of your plugin definition.
-   Export your plugin definition type using the `ConversationPluginDefinitionFromPlugin` type exported by the library. (requires your plugin to be written in TypeScript)

    ```ts
    import { createConversationPlugin, ConversationPluginDefinitionFromPlugin } from "gpt-turbo";

    const myPlugin = createConversationPlugin(myPluginName, /* ... */);

    export type MyPluginDefinition = ConversationPluginDefinitionFromPlugin<
        typeof myPlugin
    >;

    export default myPlugin;
    ```

-   Export a type guard for dynamic type checking of your conversation plugin (requires your plugin to be written in TypeScript)

    ```ts
    import { ConversationPluginDefinition } from "gpt-turbo";

    export const isStatsPlugin = (
        plugin?: ConversationPluginDefinition<any, any, any>
    ): plugin is MyPluginDefinition => plugin?.name === myPluginName;
    ```
