Using conversation plugins let's you enhance the functionality of conversations for a specific use-case not covered by the library.
One example of such use case is the ability to get usage stats for a conversation, which the [`gpt-turbo-plugin-stats`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/gpt-turbo-plugin-stats) accomplishes.
Since this plugin is homemade, we'll be using it as an example throughout this guide, but roughly the same principles apply to any other plugin.

## Finding plugins

While it's not mandatory, we recommend plugin authors to publish their plugins on NPM with some guidelines to make it easier for users to find them.

- **Strongly recommended**: The package should have the `gpt-turbo-plugin` keyword. [Search NPM for this keyword](https://www.npmjs.com/search?q=keywords:gpt-turbo-plugin).
- The package name should start with `gpt-turbo-plugin-`.

## Installation

Install your plugin as a dependency to your project:

> Only for `gpt-turbo-plugin-stats`: the version you install should match the version of GPT Turbo you're using.

```bash
npm install gpt-turbo-plugin-stats
```

## Usage

Plugins are functions that you pass to the `plugins` property of the `Conversation` constructor.
These functions will be called by the conversation's `PluginService` with everything a plugin can access to do *stuff* (i.e.: the conversation itself and all it's properties).
All you need to do is provide that function:

```ts
import { Conversation } from "gpt-turbo";
import statsPlugin from "gpt-turbo-plugin-stats";

const conversation = new Conversation({
    plugins: [statsPlugin]
});
```

## Global plugins

You can also define plugins globally, which mean they'll be used by all conversations **after** you've defined them:

```ts
import { Conversation } from "gpt-turbo";
import statsPlugin from "gpt-turbo-plugin-stats";

// No plugins
const c1 = new Conversation();

Conversation.globalPlugins = [statsPlugin];

// Stats plugin
const c2 = new Conversation();
```

### Typing global plugins

If you're using TypeScript, you should override the `ConversationGlobalPluginsOverride` interface to get proper typing for your global plugins:

```ts
import { Conversation } from "gpt-turbo";
import statsPlugin from "gpt-turbo-plugin-stats";

const globalPlugins = [statsPlugin];
Conversation.globalPlugins = globalPlugins;

declare module "gpt-turbo" {
    interface ConversationGlobalPluginsOverride {
        globalPlugins: typeof globalPlugins;
    }
}

const conversation = new Conversation();
```

## Plugin Output

Plugins define various methods so they can tap into the conversation's lifecycle internally.
Sometimes, it may be useful for them to expose some data to the client code.
For this reason, plugins can decide to define the `out` property, which can be accessed from the client code using the `getPluginOutput` method of the conversation:

```ts
const statsOutput = conversation.getPluginOutput("gpt-turbo-plugin-stats");
// const statsOutput = conversation.getPlugin("gpt-turbo-plugin-stats").out; // equivalent
```

### Plugin Output Types

When getting a plugin output through a **static** plugin name, like above, the type of the output will be inferred from the plugin's type definition.
This allows you to use the output directly, with strong types, without ever needing type guards!


```ts
const statsOutput = conversation.getPluginOutput("gpt-turbo-plugin-stats"); // ConversationStats
console.log(statsOutput.size); // number
```

However, when getting a plugin output through a **dynamic** plugin name, the type of the output will be `any`.
The reason it is `any` and not a union of all plugins is to avoid types to be too restrictive.
For example, if a plugin is dynamically added to a conversation, there would be no way of knowing the type of the output, even through a static plugin name.
Using `any` let's your intellisense suggest known plugins, while allowing you to use an unknown plugin name without error.

Another recommendation made to plugin authors is to export a type guard for such cases:

```ts
import { Conversation } from "gpt-turbo";
import statsPlugin, { isStatsPlugin } from "gpt-turbo-plugin-stats";

const conversation = new Conversation({
    plugins: [statsPlugin]
});

// getting a plugin "dynamically"
const plugin = conversation.plugins.getPlugin("gpt-turbo-plugin" + "-stats");
plugin.out; // any

if (isStatsPlugin(plugin)) {
    const stats = plugin.out; // ConversationStats
}
```
