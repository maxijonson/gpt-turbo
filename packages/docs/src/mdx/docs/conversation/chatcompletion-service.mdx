> This is an internal class. You can interact with it when authoring plugins, but you shouldn't need to instantiate it.

The `ChatCompletionService` exposes the methods used by the `Conversation` to interact with the Chat Completion API.
Unlike most other classes (of the `Conversation` class), it is not exposed as a property of the `Conversation` class.
It is essentially a utility class for internal use by the library and can be very complex to work with standalone.

However, it is exposed to plugins, in order to allow complex behaviors and side effects.
This page will cover what this service accomplishes, but there aren't much patterns to follow when using it.

## Getting a chat completion response from the API

The `getChatCompletionResponse` method is in charge of getting a response from the Chat Completion API using the appropriate handler:

- `handleStreamedResponse`: used when the `stream` option is enabled.
- `handleNonStreamedResponse`: used when the `stream` option is disabled.

It then returns the response as a `Promise<Message>`.

### Handling a streamed response

When the `stream` option is enabled, the `handleStreamedResponse` method will be used to get a response from the Chat Completion API.
One particular distinction of this method is that it is **synchronous**. 
It does not wait for the API response to be received, because it is easy to predict the initial state of the message:

- The message content will be empty.
- The message will be updated internally, periodically, as the API sends new data.

The goal here is to get the message instance out as soon as possible.
This allows client code to subscribe to the message's events, such as `onUpdate` or `onContentStream`, without missing any event.

### Handling a non-streamed response

When the `stream` option is disabled, the `handleNonStreamedResponse` method will be used to get a response from the Chat Completion API.
Unlike the previous handler, this one is **asynchronous**.
It will wait for the API response to be received, and then return the message instance.

## Getting the assistant's response

The `getAssistantResponse` method is a wrapper around the `getChatCompletionResponse` method.
It gets the chat completion response, moderates it, adds the message to the `ConversationHistory` and returns the message.

### Moderation

The `moderateMessage` method is a wrapper around the `moderate` method of the `Message` class.
The role of the `Message.moderate` method is only to get the message's moderation status.
The `moderateMessage` method will use this status to determine whether or not it should throw a `ModerationException`.
