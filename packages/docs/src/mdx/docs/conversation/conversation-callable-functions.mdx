> This is an internal class. You'll interact with it and configure it through the `Conversation` class, but you shouldn't need to instantiate it.

The `ConversationCallableFunctions` class is what keeps track of the callable functions in a conversation and manages them.

## Configuring in conversation constructor

You'll most likely be interacting with this class through the `Conversation` class.
More specifically, through the `callableFunctions` property of the `Conversation` constructor.

```ts
const conversation = new Conversation({
    callableFunctions: {
        /* options */
    },
});
```

The options you pass are conveniently the same as the [`toJSON`](#serialization-and-deserialization) method:

-   `functions`: The callable functions available to the conversation.
    These should be a [JSON representation of a `CallableFunction`](../callable-function/callable-function#serialization-and-deserialization).

## Managing Callable Functions

The `ConversationCallableFunctions` class has various methods to manage the functions available in the conversation.

### Adding Callable Functions

You can add a function using the `addFunction` method.
This method takes either a [`CallableFunction`](../callable-function/callable-function) instance or a [JSON representation of a `CallableFunction`](../callable-function/callable-function#serialization-and-deserialization).

```ts
const callableFunction = new CallableFunction(/* ... */);

conversation.callableFunctions.addFunction(callableFunction);
conversation.callableFunctions.addFunction(callableFunction.toJSON());
```

### Getting the Callable Functions

You can get the callable functions in the conversation using the `getFunctions` method.

```ts
const callableFunctions = conversation.callableFunctions.getFunctions();
```

### Removing Callable Functions

You can remove a specific callable function with the `removeFunction` method or remove all of them with the `clearFunctions` method.

```ts
const callableFunction = new CallableFunction(/* ... */);
conversation.callableFunctions.addFunction(callableFunction);

// Remove a specific function
conversation.callableFunctions.removeFunction(callableFunction);
conversation.callableFunctions.removeFunction(callableFunction.id);

// Remove all functions
conversation.callableFunctions.clearFunctions();
```

## Event Listeners

You can listen to various events on a `ConversationCallableFunctions` instance.
These allow you to react to certain events, such as when a function is added.

All events shown below have an `on`, `once` and `off` method (e.g: `onCallableFunctionAdded`, `onceCallableFunctionAdded`, `offCallableFunctionAdded`).

-   `on`: Adds a listener to the event. Takes a callback function as an argument.
-   `once`: Same as `on`, but the listener will only be called once before being automatically unsubscribed.
-   `off`: Removes a listener from the event. Takes the callback function passed to `on` or `once` as an argument.

### CallableFunctionAdded

This event fires when a function is added to the callable functions, with the following arguments:

-   `callableFunction`: The function that was added.

### CallableFunctionRemoved

This event fires when a function is removed to the callable functions, with the following arguments:

-   `callableFunction`: The function that was removed.

## Serialization and Deserialization

You can serialize the conversation callable functions to JSON using the `toJSON` method.
This is especially useful if you want to persist a conversation callable functions in a database or file.
Use the `toJSON` method to serialize a conversation callable functions to JSON.

```ts
const callableFunctions = conversation.callableFunctions;
const callableFunctionsJson = callableFunctions.toJSON();
```

You can then deserialize a conversation callable functions from JSON using the `fromJSON` static method.

```ts
const callableFunctions = ConversationCallableFunctions.fromJSON(callableFunctionsJson);

// ... do some operations on the callableFunctions ...

const conversation = new Conversation({ callableFunctions: callableFunctions.toJSON() });
```

> The conversation callable functions are automatically serialized/deserialized when serializing a `Conversation`.
> You should only use these methods if you want to serialize/deserialize only the `ConversationCallableFunctions`.
