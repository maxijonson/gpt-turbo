> This is an internal class. You'll interact with it and configure it through the `Conversation` class, but you shouldn't need to instantiate it.

The conversation history is what keeps track of the messages in a conversation and manages them.

## Configuring in conversation constructor

You'll most likely be interacting with this class through the `Conversation` class.
More specifically, through the `history` property of the `Conversation` constructor.

```ts
const conversation = new Conversation({
    history: {
        /* options */
    },
});
```

The options you pass are conveniently the same as the [`toJSON`](#serialization-and-deserialization) method:

-   `messages`: The messages in the conversation history, including the context message.
    These messages should be a [JSON representation of a `Message`](../message/message#serialization-and-deserialization).

## Conversation Context

> By default, the conversation context is `You are a large language model trained by OpenAI. Answer as concisely as possible.`

The conversation context is set by the very first message of the conversation with the role of `system`.
You can see this message as the "message zero" of the conversation and in most cases, you won't need to show this message to the user.

From OpenAI's [documentation](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/gpt/chat-completions-api):

> _The system message helps set the behavior of the assistant.
> For example, you can modify the personality of the assistant or provide specific instructions about how it should behave throughout the conversation.
> However note that the system message is optional and the model's behavior without a system message is likely to be similar to using a generic message such as "You are a helpful assistant."_

You can set the context using the `setContext` method and get the context using the `getContext` method.

```ts
conversation.history.setContext("You are a helpful assistant.");
const context = conversation.history.getContext();
```

## Managing messages

The `ConversationHistory` class has various methods to manage the messages in the conversation.

### Adding messages

You can add a message using the `addMessage` method, or specific methods like `addUserMessage` or `addAssistantMessage`.

```ts
// Manual way
conversation.history.addMessage(new Message("user", "Hello there!"));

// User message
conversation.history.addUserMessage("Hello there!");

// Assistant message
conversation.history.addAssistantMessage("Hello there!");

// System message
conversation.history.setContext("Hello there!");

// Function call (by the assistant)
conversation.history.addFunctionCallMessage({
    name: "sayHello",
    arguments: { to: "John" },
});

// Function message (by the user (client code))
conversation.history.addFunctionMessage("{ action: 'greet', to: 'John' }");
```

### Getting messages

You can get the messages in the conversation using the `getMessages` method.
This method also accepts an optional parameter `includeContext` which defaults to `false`.
When `true`, the context message will be included in the returned messages.

```ts
const messages = conversation.history.getMessages();
const messagesWithContext = conversation.history.getMessages(true);
```

### Removing messages

You can remove a specific message with the `removeMessage` method or remove all messages with the `clearMessages` method.

```ts
const message = new Message("user", "Hello there!");
conversation.history.addMessage(message);

// Remove a specific message
conversation.history.removeMessage(message);
conversation.history.removeMessage(message.id);

// Remove all messages
conversation.history.clearMessages();
```

## Event Listeners

You can listen to various events on a `ConversationHistory` instance.
These allow you to react to certain events, such as when a message is added.

All events shown below have an `on`, `once` and `off` method (e.g: `onMessageAdded`, `onceMessageAdded`, `offMessageAdded`).

-   `on`: Adds a listener to the event. Takes a callback function as an argument.
-   `once`: Same as `on`, but the listener will only be called once before being automatically unsubscribed.
-   `off`: Removes a listener from the event. Takes the callback function passed to `on` or `once` as an argument.

> Except for the Content Stream event, you should make sure to unsubscribe from the event when you no longer need it, **otherwise you risk memory leaks**.

### MessageAdded

This event fires when a message is added to the history, with the following arguments:

-   `message`: The message that was added.

### MessageRemoved

This event fires when a message is removed to the history, with the following arguments:

-   `message`: The message that was removed.

## Serialization and Deserialization

You can serialize the conversation history to JSON using the `toJSON` method.
This is especially useful if you want to persist a conversation history in a database or file.
Use the `toJSON` method to serialize a conversation history to JSON.

```ts
const history = conversation.history.toJSON();
const historyJson = history.toJSON();
```

You can then deserialize a conversation history from JSON using the `fromJSON` static method.

```ts
const history = ConversationHistory.fromJSON(historyJson);

// ... do some operations on the history ...

const conversation = new Conversation({ history: history.toJSON() });
```

> The conversation history is automatically serialized/deserialized when serializing a `Conversation`.
> You should only use these methods if you want to serialize/deserialize only the `ConversationHistory`.
