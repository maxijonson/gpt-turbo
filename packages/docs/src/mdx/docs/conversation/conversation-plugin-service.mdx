> This is an internal class. You can interact with it when authoring plugins, but you shouldn't need to instantiate it.

The `ConversationPluginService` is an internal class used as middleware between a `Conversation` and its `ConversationPlugins`.

It essentially exposes the same methods as plugins, but is in charge of passing on the arguments to each plugins so the `Conversation` doesn't have to.
For this reason, there is nothing much to document here.
Refer to the [authoring `ConversationPlugin`s documentation](../conversation-plugins/authoring-plugins#plugin-definition-properties) for the plugin methods it exposes.
