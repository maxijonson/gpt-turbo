> This is an internal class. You'll interact with it and configure it through the `Conversation` class, but you shouldn't need to instantiate it.

The `ConversationPlugins` class manages the plugins available to a conversation.
It is also possible for client code to interact with this class through the `Conversation` class in order to access the plugins and their output (`out` property).

## Configuring in conversation constructor

You'll most likely be interacting with this class through the `Conversation` class.
More specifically, through the `plugins` property of the `Conversation` constructor.

```ts
const conversation = new Conversation({
    plugins: [
        /* plugins */
    ],
});
```

For example, if you wanted to use the `gpt-turbo-plugin-stats` plguin, you'd do the following:

```ts
import { Conversation } from "gpt-turbo";
import statsPlugin from "gpt-turbo-plugin-stats";

const conversation = new Conversation({
    plugins: [statsPlugin]
});
```

> In the example above, `statsPlugin` is actually a function that returns a plugin **definition**, which contains a plugin's lifecycle hooks.
> Internally, this function is referred to as a "plugin **creator**".
> The `ConversationPluginService` class calls the plugin **creator** during the `onInit` lifecycle hook in order to get the plugin **definition**.
> Beyond that, the plugin **creator** is not used and only the plugin **definition** is used.
>
> That being said, the "plugin" word alone takes on different meanings depending on the context:
> - **Plugin creator**: when we're talking about a plugin outside of a `Conversation` instance, like the one we're importing or passing to the `Conversation` constructor.
> - **Plugin definition**: when we're talking about a plugin from within a `Conversation` instance, like the one we're [accessing](#accessing-plugins) through the `plugins` property of the `Conversation` instance. 

## Accessing plugins

There are various ways you get access to a plugin (definition) in order to interact with it from your client code.
In most cases, you'll be using the plugin's `out` property to get the plugin's output, which is a property that is set by the plugin itself and specifically made to be accessed by client code.
However, the library also allows you to access the plugin's definition directly, which is useful if you want to interact with the plugin's lifecycle hooks manually.

### Getting all plugins

You can retrieve all of the plugins of a conversation through the `getPlugins` method.

```ts
const plugins = conversation.plugins.getPlugins();
```

### Getting a specific plugin by name

You can retrieve a specific plugin of a conversation, by name, through the `getPlugin` method.

If you use a static name (i.e. either a constant or a string literal), the returned plugin will be strongly typed, meaning its `out` property will be typed accordingly, given the plugin has a strictly typed plugin output.

```ts
import statsPlugin, { statsPluginName } from "gpt-turbo-plugin-stats";

const conversation = new Conversation({
    plugins: [statsPlugin, someOtherPlugin]
});

const plugin = conversation.plugins.getPlugin(statsPluginName); // ConversationPluginDefinition<"gpt-turbo-plugin-stats", ConversationStats, StatsPluginData>
plugin.out; // ConversationStats
```

If you're using a static name, but it isn't a known name of the plugins passed to the `Conversation` constructor, the returned plugin will be loosely typed with `any`.

> If the plugin is not found at runtime, this will throw an error.
> Use `safeGetPlugin` instead if you want to avoid this, which will return `undefined` instead.

```ts
const plugin = conversation.plugins.getPlugin("asdf"); // ConversationPluginDefinition<"asdf", any, any>
plugin.out; // any
```

If you use a dynamic name, the returned plugin will be loosely typed with the union of all known plugins.

> If you've loaded the plugins dynamically in the `Conversation` constructor, even using a static name will result in a loosely typed plugin.
> This is because the `getPlugin` method's types relies on the type of the `plugins` property of the `Conversation` constructor.
> If this property is loosely typed as a `ConversationPluginDefinition[]` instead of specific plugin types, then the `getPlugin` method can't infer it's type just from a string.

```ts
const pluginName = getPluginNameFromSomewhere(); // string
const plugin = conversation.plugins.getPlugin(pluginName); // ConversationPluginDefinition<string, ConversationStats | SomeOtherPlugin, StatsPluginData | SomeOtherPluginData>
plugin.out; // ConversationStats | SomeOtherPlugin
```

### Getting a specific plugin output by name

Since you'll mostly be using the `out` property of a plugin, there's a shorthand method similar to `getPlugin` that returns the `out` property of a plugin directly: `getPluginOutput` (and `safeGetPluginOutput`).

```ts
const pluginOutput = conversation.plugins.getPluginOutput(statsPluginName); // ConversationStats
```
