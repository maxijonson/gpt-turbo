> This is an internal class. You'll interact with it and configure it through the `Conversation` class, but you shouldn't need to instantiate it.

The `ConversationRequestOptions` is responsible for configuring options to use when sending HTTP requests to OpenAI's API, whether it's the Chat Completion API or the Moderation API.

## Configuring in conversation constructor

You'll most likely be interacting with this class through the `Conversation` class.
More specifically, through the `requestOptions` property of the `Conversation` constructor.

```ts
const conversation = new Conversation({
    requestOptions: {
        /* options */
    },
});
```

The options you pass are conveniently the same as the [`toJSON`](#serialization-and-deserialization) method:

-   `headers`: Additional headers to send with the request.
    These are also sent to the proxy, if one is configured.
-   `proxy`: The proxy to use when sending the request.
    This is an object with the following properties:
    -   `host`: The proxy host.
    -   `port`: The proxy port.
    -   `protocol`: The proxy protocol. Either `"http"` or `"https"`.
    -   `auth`: The proxy authentication.
        This is an object with the following properties:
        -   `username`: The proxy username.
        -   `password`: The proxy password.
        
    > A header `Proxy-Authorization` is automatically added to the request with the proxy authentication.
    > You shouldn't need to add it yourself unless you want to override the default value of "Basic {auth}" where `{auth}` is a base64-encoded string of the `username:password`.

## Serialization and Deserialization

You can serialize the conversation request options to JSON using the `toJSON` method.
This is especially useful if you want to persist the request options in a database or file.
Use the `toJSON` method to serialize them to JSON.

```ts
const requestOptions = conversation.requestOptions;
const requestOptionsJson = requestOptions.toJSON();
```

You can then deserialize a conversation's request options from JSON using the `fromJSON` static method.

```ts
const requestOptions = ConversationRequestOptions.fromJSON(requestOptionsJson);

// ... do some operations on the requestOptions ...

const conversation = new Conversation({
    requestOptions: requestOptions.toJSON(),
});
```

> The conversation's request options are automatically serialized/deserialized when serializing a `Conversation`.
> You should only use these methods if you want to serialize/deserialize only the `ConversationRequestOptions`.
