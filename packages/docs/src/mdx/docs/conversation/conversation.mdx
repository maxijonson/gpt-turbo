The `Conversation` class is the main class you'll be interacting with.
It allows you to easily interact with the Chat Completion API with a few methods.
Internally, it uses multiple other classes to handle the heavy lifting.
These are outlined in the next sections.

## Creating a Conversation

To create a conversation, you need to instantiate the `Conversation` class.
If you pass no parameters, it will use default settings to instantiate its internal classes.
However, at the very least, you'll want to pass in an API key, otherwise the conversation will run in dry mode by default.

```ts
import { Conversation } from "gpt-turbo";

const apiKey = "sk-1234567890abcdefg";
const conversation = new Conversation({ config: { apiKey } });
```
