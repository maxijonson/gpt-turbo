The `Conversation` class is the main class you'll be interacting with.
It allows you to easily interact with the Chat Completion API with a few methods.
Internally, it uses multiple other classes to handle the heavy lifting.
These are outlined in the next sections.

## Creating a Conversation

To create a conversation, you need to instantiate the `Conversation` class.
If you pass no parameters, it will use default settings to instantiate its internal classes.
However, at the very least, you'll want to pass in an API key, otherwise the conversation will run in dry mode by default.

```ts
import { Conversation } from "gpt-turbo";

const apiKey = "sk-1234567890abcdefg";
const conversation = new Conversation({ config: { apiKey } });
// const conversation = new Conversation(); // Works, but runs in dry mode
```

## Conversation Configuration

In the example above, we configured the conversation config property of the conversation through the `config` property.
Behind the scenes, the constructor passes these properties to the `ConversationConfig` class instance.
Here are all the properties you can pass to a `Conversation` constructor:

- `config`: Configures the [`ConversationConfig`](/docs/conversation/conversation-config) 
- `requestOptions`: Configures the [`ConversationRequestOptions`](/docs/conversation/conversation-request-options) 
- `history`: Configures the [`ConversationHistory`](/docs/conversation/conversation-history) 
- `callableFunctions`: Configures the [`ConversationCallableFunctions`](/docs/conversation/conversation-callable-functions) 
- `plugins`: Registers the plugins to the [`ConversationPluginService`](/docs/conversation/conversation-plugin-service), which is used by the [`ConversationPlugins`](/docs/conversation/conversation-plugins) class.
- `pluginsData`: Data passed to the plugins on initialization, usually passed when creating a conversation from a JSON representation of a conversation (i.e. with `fromJSON`)
