description: GPT Turbo's main class for interacting with the Chat Completion API
order: 0
---

The `Conversation` class is the main class you'll be interacting with.
It allows you to easily interact with the Chat Completion API with a few methods.
Internally, it uses multiple other classes to handle the heavy lifting.
These are outlined in the next sections.

## Creating a Conversation

To create a conversation, you need to instantiate the `Conversation` class.
If you pass no parameters, it will use default settings to instantiate its internal classes.
However, at the very least, you'll want to pass in an API key, otherwise the conversation will run in dry mode by default.

```ts
import { Conversation } from "gpt-turbo";

const apiKey = "sk-1234567890abcdefg";
const conversation = new Conversation({ config: { apiKey } });
// const conversation = new Conversation(); // Works, but runs in dry mode
```

## Constructor

In the example above, we configured the conversation config property of the conversation through the `config` property.
Behind the scenes, the constructor passes these properties to the `ConversationConfig` class instance.
Here are all the properties you can pass to a `Conversation` constructor:

-   `config`: Configures the [`ConversationConfig`](/docs/conversation/conversation-config)
-   `requestOptions`: Configures the [`ConversationRequestOptions`](/docs/conversation/conversation-request-options)
-   `history`: Configures the [`ConversationHistory`](/docs/conversation/conversation-history)
-   `callableFunctions`: Configures the [`ConversationCallableFunctions`](/docs/conversation/conversation-callable-functions)
-   `plugins`: Registers the plugins to the [`ConversationPluginService`](/docs/conversation/conversation-plugin-service), which is used by the [`ConversationPlugins`](/docs/conversation/conversation-plugins) class.
-   `pluginsData`: Data passed to the plugins on initialization, usually passed when creating a conversation from a JSON representation of a conversation (i.e. with `fromJSON`)

## Prompting

Once you've created a conversation, you can use the `prompt` method to prompt the API for a completion.

> This is the recommended way to use the Chat Completion API with GPT Turbo.
> It takes care of hidden steps, such as adding a user message to the history, moderating the message, and more.
> If you want to take more control over the prompt lifecycle, check out the [manual history management example](/docs/recipes/manual-history-management).

```ts
const conversation = new Conversation(/* ... */);
const response = await conversation.prompt("Hello there!");
console.log(response.content);
```

### Override chat completion parameters for a single prompt

The `prompt` method takes an optional second argument, `options`, which allows you to override some chat completion parameters, previously given to the `config` parameter of the `Conversation` constructor.

```ts
const conversation = new Conversation({ config: { model: "gpt-3.5-turbo" } });
const response = await conversation.prompt("Hello there!", { model: "gpt-4" });
```

### Override request options for a single prompt

Similarly, the `prompt` method takes an optional third argument, `requestOptions`, which allows you to override some request options, previously given to the `requestOptions` parameter of the `Conversation` constructor.

```ts
const conversation = new Conversation({
    requestOptions: { headers: { Some_Header: "value" } },
});
const response = await conversation.prompt("Hello there!", undefined, {
    headers: { Some_Header: "other value" },
});
```

## Reprompting

The `reprompt` method is a convenience method to reprompt the conversation from a previous message.
It takes care of removing messages from the reprompted message and prompts the API with a new message or the same user message.

The last two arguments (of the 4) are the same as the `prompt` method and do the same thing: `options` and `requestOptions`.

### Remprompting with the same message

To reprompt a message re-using the same user message (but different answer), you can pass the previous response to the `reprompt` method.

```ts
const conversation = new Conversation(/* ... */);
const r1 = await conversation.prompt("Name a strength of the clone army."); // They are good soldiers who follow orders
const r2 = await conversation.prompt("Name a weakness of the clone army."); // They are not expandable

// history:
// User:        Name a strength of the clone army.
// Assistant:   They are good soldiers who follow orders.
// User:        Name a weakness of the clone army.
// Assistant:   They are not expandable.

const newR1 = await conversation.reprompt(r1); // They aim better than stormtroopers
// const newR1 = await conversation.reprompt(r1.id); // Alternative syntax

// history:
// User:        Name a strength of the clone army.
// Assistant:   They aim better than stormtroopers
```

### Reprompting with a new message

You can specify a new message to reprompt with by passing the prompt as second argument.

```ts
const conversation = new Conversation(/* ... */);
const r1 = await conversation.prompt("Name a strength of the clone army."); // They are good soldiers who follow orders
const r2 = await conversation.prompt("Name a weakness of the clone army."); // They are not expandable

// history:
// User:        Name a strength of the clone army.
// Assistant:   They are good soldiers who follow orders.
// User:        Name a weakness of the clone army.
// Assistant:   They are not expandable.

const newR1 = await conversation.reprompt(
    r1,
    "Name a strength of the droid army."
); // They're good at roger-rogering

// history:
// User:        Name a strength of the droid army.
// Assistant:   They're good at roger-rogering
```

## Function Prompting

If you have defined callable functions in your conversation, the assistant may decide to call one of them (or may not, if `function_call` is `"auto"`).
In the event that it does, you can use the `functionPrompt` method to send the result of the called function to the assistant, after which it will respond to.
Think of the `functionPrompt` as a way to let the assistant know what is the result of its function call.

The function prompt `result` argument takes **any** type of value.
In the end, if the value is not a string, it will be serialized using `JSON.stringify`.

The last two arguments (of the 4) are the same as the `prompt` method and do the same thing: `options` and `requestOptions`.

```ts
import { Conversation, CallableFunction, CallableFunctionNumber } from "gpt-turbo";

// This is the true function that will be called
const executeOrder = (order: number) => {
    if (order === 66) {
        return "Yes, my lord.";
    }
    // ...
    else {
        return "I'm sorry, I don't understand.";
    }
};

// This is a representation of the above function for the API
const executeOrderFn = new CallableFunction("executeOrder", "Executes an order embedded in clone troopers.");
executeOrderFn.addParameter(new CallableFunctionNumber("order", "The order number to execute"), true);

const conversation = new Conversation({
    callableFunctions: { 
        functions: [executeOrderFn]
    }
});

const r1 = await conversation.prompt("Execute order 66."); // [function call: "executeOrder", arguments: { order: 66 }]

if (r1.isFunctionCall()) {
    const { order } = r1.functionCall.arguments;
    const result = executeOrder(order);

    // Here, we're basically telling the assistant "Hey, you asked to call the 'executeOrder' function with order=66 as argument, and the result is 'Yes, my lord.'. Now, please respond to that."
    const r2 = await conversation.functionPrompt(r1.functionCall.name, result); // Order 66 executed.
}
```

## Serialization and Deserialization

You can serialize a conversation to JSON using the `toJSON` method.
This is especially useful if you want to persist a conversation in a database or file.
Use the `toJSON` method to serialize a conversation to JSON.

```ts
const conversation = new Conversation(/* ... */);
const conversationJson = conversation.toJSON();
```

You can then deserialize a conversation from JSON using the `fromJSON` static method.

```ts
const conversation = Conversation.fromJSON(conversationJson);
```

### Registering plugins during deserialization

Since plugins can't be serialized (but their `pluginData` can), you'll need to provide those seperately when deserializing a conversation.
If your plugins defined the `getPluginData` function, their data should already be in the conversation JSON and will be given to the plugins automatically on their initialization.

```ts
const conversation = Conversation.fromJSON(conversationJson, [myPlugin1, myPlugin2]);
```
