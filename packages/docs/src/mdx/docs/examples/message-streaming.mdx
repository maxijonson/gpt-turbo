title: Message Streaming
description: Get the message content as it is being created, like ChatGPT.
---

By default, messsage responses are returned in a single string. However, you can also stream a message as it is generated, just like ChatGPT.

To do this, you need to set the `stream` option to `true` when creating a `Conversation` instance. 
Then, you can use the `onContentStream` method to listen for new content as it is generated.

```ts
import { Conversation } from "gpt-turbo";

const conversation = new Conversation({
    config: {
        apiKey,
        stream: true,
    },
});

const response = await conversation.prompt(
    "How can I make my code more efficient than a droid army?"
);

// New method (v5). Recommended for streamed responses as it automatically unsubscribes when the streaming stops.
response.onContentStream(async (content, isStreaming) => {
    console.log(content);
});

// Legacy method (v4). Still supported, but you need to unsubscribe manually.
const unsubscribeUpdate = response.onUpdate((content) => {
    console.log(content);
});

const unsubscribeStop = response.onStreamingStop(() => {
    unsubscribeUpdate();
    unsubscribeStop();
});
```
