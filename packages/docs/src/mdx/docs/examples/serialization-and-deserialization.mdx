title: Serialization and Deserialization
description: Save and load your data in a JSON format
---

Almost every class in the library can be serialized to JSON and deserialized from JSON. 
This is useful for saving and loading data to and from disk, or for sending data over the network.

The classes you'll most likely be using for serialization are the following, but keep in mind most internal classes are also serializable/deserializable:

- `Conversation`
- `Message`
- `CallableFunction`

## Serialization

Serializable classes have a `toJSON()` method that returns a JSON object.


```ts
import { Conversation } from "gpt-turbo";
import { save } from "./utils/db.js";

const conversation = new Conversation();

const response = await conversation.prompt("How can I optimize my code to be faster than the Millennium Falcon's Kessel Run?");
console.log(`Response: ${response.content}`);

await save(conversation.toJSON());
```

## Deserialization

Deserializable classes have a `fromJSON()` static method that returns an instance of the class.

```ts
import { Conversation } from "gpt-turbo";
import { load } from "./utils/db.js";

const conversationJson = await load();
const conversation = await Conversation.fromJSON(conversationJson);
// ...
```
