## Install GPT Turbo

Install GPT Turbo using your favorite package manager:

```bash
npm install gpt-turbo
```

## (optional) Environment setup with dotenv

Unless your app is meant to be 100% local, you'll probably ship your app somewhere or at least push it to a git repository.
In that case, it is **highly recommended** to setup environment variables to avoid leaking your API keys.
While you may choose `process.env` directly or another library, it's recommended to use [dotenv](https://www.npmjs.com/package/dotenv), which will be shown below.

Install dotenv:

```bash
npm install dotenv
```

Create a `.env` file in the root of your project and add the following:

```txt
OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-...
```

Add `.env` to your `.gitignore` file to avoid committing it to your repository.

Finally, you'll need to call `dotenv.config()` somewhere in your app, preferably as early as possible (e.g. in your `index.ts` file).
You can also export the specific variables so you don't need to type and call `process.env` everywhere:

```ts
/// config.ts
import dotenv from 'dotenv';
dotenv.config();

export const OPENAI_API_KEY = process.env.OPENAI_API_KEY;

/// index.ts
import "./config";

// ...
```

## Usage

You're now ready to use GPT Turbo in your app!
You can test out the following basic example:

```ts
import { Conversation } from "gpt-turbo";
import { OPENAI_API_KEY } from "./config";

const conversation = new Conversation({ config: { apiKey: OPENAI_API_KEY } });
const response = await conversation.prompt("Hello there!");

console.log(response.content);
```
