## What is GPT Turbo?

GPT Turbo is a JavaScript library (with TypeScript-first support) for interacting with OpenAI's Chat Completion API. 
It focuses on **covering 100% of the API surface**, while providing a simple, intuitive, and type-safe interface.

## Features

🤖 Supports all Chat Completion models, including **GPT-4**. (full list [here](https://platform.openai.com/docs/models/model-endpoint-compatibility))

💬 Supports both single, streamed and function completions, just like ChatGPT.

⚙ Tune chat completion parameters, such as temperature, top-p, and frequency penalty.

🌐 Compatible in both Node.js and the browser.

📜 Keeps track of the conversation history for you, making conversation continuity a breeze.

💰 Estimate the cost and size of conversations before sending them to the API. (*through the `gpt-turbo-plugin-stats` plugin*)

💾 Easily persist conversations with serialization and deserialization methods.

🔌 Includes a plugin system for extending the library's functionality.

💻 Built entirely with TypeScript.

⚔️ Battle-tested in multiple environments. (See [implementations](#implementations))

## Implementations

Here's a list of all the home-made [implementations](https://github.com/maxijonson/gpt-turbo/tree/develop/packages/implementations) of GPT Turbo:

- [Web](https://gpt-turbo-web.chintristan.io/): A web app, very similar to ChatGPT, for handling chats in the browser.
- [Discord](https://discord.com/invite/Aa77KCmwRx): A Discord bot for chatting in Discord servers, similar to Discord's own Clyde AI bot.
- [CLI](https://www.npmjs.com/package/gpt-turbo-cli): A command-line interface to chat straight from your terminal.
- [Nest](https://github.com/maxijonson/gpt-turbo/tree/develop/packages/implementations/nest): A NestJS backend, for interacting with the library via a REST API.

## Plugins

Here's a list of all the home-made [plugins](https://github.com/maxijonson/gpt-turbo/tree/develop/packages/plugins) for GPT Turbo:

- [gpt-turbo-plugin-stats](https://www.npmjs.com/package/gpt-turbo-plugin-stats): A plugin for estimating the cost and size of conversations before sending them to the API.

## Differences from OpenAI's official library

While OpenAI provides an official JavaScript library for interacting with the API, it focuses on providing a basic interface for all of their APIs. 
This is fine when you're working with multiple of them, but not ideal when you just want to use the Chat Completion API.
GPT Turbo is designed to be a **dedicated library for the Chat Completion API**, and thus provides a much more intuitive interface.

One of the pain points of working with the API directly or OpenAI's official JavaScript library was keeping track of the message history.
Since you need to send the entire history of messages for each prompt, you need an efficient way to store and update the history.
GPT Turbo solves this by providing a `Conversation` class that handles all of this for you.
While conversation history management was the main motivation for creating this library, it has grown to do much more than that.
GPT Turbo also supports proxy configuration, message streaming\*, callable functions and plugins.

Another issue with OpenAI's library is that it is designed as a server-side library, and thus does not support the browser.
GPT Turbo is completely isomorphic, and **works in both Node.js and the browser**.

\**Message streaming is part of OpenAI's Chat Completion API, but it uses server-sent events, which can be cumbersome to work with. 
GPT Turbo works wraps these server-sent events into a more convenient interface.*
