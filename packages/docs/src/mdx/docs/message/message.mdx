In order to have conversation continuity, every message in the conversation must be (re-)sent to the API when prompting for a new response.
To make this mechanism a breeze, the `ConversationHistory` instance of a `Conversation` keeps track of all `Message`s.

## Creating a message

To create a conversation, you need to instantiate the `Message` class.
At its core, a `Message` has a `role`, the `model` they were created with/for and a `content` string (or `null`. More on that later!).

```ts
import { Message } from "gpt-turbo";

const message = new Message("user", "Hello there!", "gpt-3.5-turbo");
```

Although it's not recommended, you can instantiate a `Message` without any arguments.
You should do this when you want to create an instance where properties will be set later.

```ts
const message = new Message(); // equivalent to new Message("user", "", "")
```

## Message Roles

The message role can be one of the following:

-   `"system"`: The first message in the history, which represents the conversation's context.
    There can only be one or zero system message in a conversation and it must be the first message.
    Setting a good system message can greatly impact the quality of the conversation for a specific context.
    This is (probably) very similar to what ChatGPT's Custom Instructions are, since you're giving ChatGPT some "context" about you.
-   `"user"`: A prompt sent by the user. (you)
-   `"assistant"`: A response to a prompt, sent by the GPT model.
    assistant messages can be one of two types:
    -   Chat Completion: A regular response where `content` is a string.
    -   Function Call: A response where `content` is `null` and instead a `functionCall` object with `name` and `arguments` is present:
        -   `name`: The name of the function to call.
        -   `arguments`: An object where the key is the name of the argument and the value is the value of the argument.
-   `"function"`: Similar to a `"user"` message, but instead of being a text prompt, it is rather a result of a function call.
    Usually, after a function call by the assistant, your code should evaluate the result of the real function and send it back to the API as a `"function"` message.
    A function message has a `name` and `content` property: - `name`: The name of the function called. - `content`: A stringified representation of the result of the function call.

> You'll notice in these docs that we never use "ChatGPT" when referring to the assistant.
> This isn't for copyright or some other legal reason, but rather because it would be innacurate.
> ChatGPT is a **product** powered by OpenAI's Chat Completion API.
> The assistant is the actual term used to refer to the **GPT model responses**.

### Role Type Guards

A `Message` can have different properties depending on its role (e.g: `content` is **always** a string for completions, but **always** `null` for function calls).
Because of this, without type guards, `content` is always `string | null`.
Luckily, there are some type guard methods that will narrow down the message properties to a **strict type**:

-   `isCompletion()`: `role` will be one of `"system"`, `"user"` or `"assistant"`.
    `content` will be a string.
    `functionCall` and `name` will be `undefined`.
-   `isFunctionCall()`: `role` will be `"assistant"`.
    `content` will be `null`.
    `functionCall` will be defined.
-   `isFunction()`: `role` will be `"function"`.
    `content` will be a string.
    `name` will be defined.

```ts
// content = string | null. role = "system" | "user" | "assistant" | "function". ...
const response = await conversation.prompt(/* ... */);

if (response.isCompletion()) {
    // content = string. role = "system" | "user" | "assistant". ...
} else if (response.isFunctionCall()) {
    // content = null. role = "assistant". functionCall = { name: string, arguments: Record<string, any> }. ...
} else if (response.isFunction()) {
    // content = string. role = "function". name = string. ...
}
```

## Moderation

You can moderate the message by calling the `moderate` method.
The method takes one required argument, your API key, and one optional argument, the request options.

Before moderating a `Message`, its `flags` property is always `null`.
After moderating a `Message`, its `flags` property will be an array of strings, where each string is a flag.
If the message is not flagged, the array will be empty.

```ts
const message = new Message("user", "Kill them all!");
console.log(message.flags) // null

await message.moderate("sk-1234");
console.log(message.flags) // ["violence"]
```

> This will use [OpenAI's Moderation API](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/moderation/overview), which is **free** for all users (as of August 2023).

## Event Listeners

You can listen to various events on a `Message` instance.
These allow you to react to certain events, such as when the message content changes.

All events shown below have an `on`, `once` and `off` method (e.g: `onUpdate`, `onceUpdate`, `offUpdate`).
-   `on`: Adds a listener to the event. Takes a callback function as an argument.
-   `once`: Same as `on`, but the listener will only be called once before being automatically unsubscribed.
-   `off`: Removes a listener from the event. Takes the callback function passed to `on` or `once` as an argument.

> Except for the Content Stream event, you should make sure to unsubscribe from the event when you no longer need it, **otherwise you risk memory leaks**.

### Update

This event fires when the `content` of a message changes, with the following arguments:
-   `content`: The new content of the message.
-   `message`: The message itself.

### StreamingUpdate

This event fires when the `isStreaming` property of a message changes, with the following arguments:
-   `isStreaming`: The new value of the `isStreaming` property.
-   `message`: The message itself.

### StreamingStart

This event fires when the `isStreaming` property of a message changes to `true`, with the following arguments:
-   `message`: The message itself.

### StreamingStop

This event fires when the `isStreaming` property of a message changes to `false`, with the following arguments:
-   `message`: The message itself.

### ContentStream

This is a special kind of event that combines both the `Update` and `StreamingUpdate` events.
It fires at every `content` change while `isStreaming` is `true`, with the following arguments:
-   `content`: The new content of the message.
-   `isStreaming`: The new value of the `isStreaming` property.
-   `message`: The message itself.

Once `isStreaming` is `false`, the event will be unsubscribed automatically.

This is a convenience listener for listening only while a message is streaming, without having to handle unsubscribes.

```ts
const conversation = new Conversation({ config: { stream: true } })
const response = await conversation.prompt(/* ... */);

response.onContentStream((content) => {
    console.log(content);
});
```

> This event will first fire for `isStreaming = true` with an empty (or not) string as the content.
> Finally, it will last fire for `isStreaming = false` with the final content.

## Serialization and Deserialization

You can serialize a message to JSON using the `toJSON` method.
This is especially useful if you want to persist a message in a database or file.
Use the `toJSON` method to serialize a message to JSON.

```ts
const message = new Message(/* ... */);
const messageJson = message.toJSON();
```

You can then deserialize a message from JSON using the `fromJSON` static method.

```ts
const message = Message.fromJSON(messageJson);
```

> Messages are automatically serialized/deserialized when serializing a `Conversation` or `ConversationHistory`.
> You should only use these methods if you want to serialize/deserialize a single message.
