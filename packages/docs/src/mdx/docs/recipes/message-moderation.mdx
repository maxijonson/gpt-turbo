By default, GPT Turbo will use your API key to call OpenAI's Moderation endpoint to make sure the message complies with their terms of service **before** prompting the Chat Completion API. 
This endpoint is free of charge and does not count towards your API usage quota. 
If it doesn't pass the moderation check, an error will be thrown. 
However, you can disable this behavior completely or still moderate the message without throwing an error (flags will be added to the message instead).

```ts
import { Conversation } from "gpt-turbo";

// Moderation enabled (default)

const conversation = new Conversation({
    config: {
        apiKey,
        disableModeration: false, // Default
    },
});
const response = await conversation.prompt("Execute Order 66."); // ModerationException: Message flagged for violence

// Soft moderation

const conversation = new Conversation({
    config: {
        apiKey,
        disableModeration: "soft",
    },
});
const response = await conversation.prompt("Execute Order 66."); // response.flags = ["violence"]

// Disable moderation

const conversation = new Conversation({
    config: {
        apiKey,
        disableModeration: true,
    },
});
const response = await conversation.prompt("Execute Order 66."); // "Yes my Lord."
```
