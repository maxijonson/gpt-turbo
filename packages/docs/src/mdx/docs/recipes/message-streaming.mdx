title: Message Streaming
description: Get the message content as it is being created, like ChatGPT.
---

By default, messsage responses are returned in a single string. However, you can also stream a message as it is generated, just like ChatGPT.

To do this, you need to set the `stream` option to `true` when creating a `Conversation` instance.
Then, you can use the `onContentStream` method to listen for new content as it is generated.

```ts
import { Conversation } from "gpt-turbo";

const conversation = new Conversation({
    config: {
        apiKey,
        stream: true,
    },
});

const response = await conversation.prompt(
    "How can I make my code more efficient than a droid army?"
);

response.onContentStream(async (content, isStreaming) => {
    console.log(content);
});
```

## Legacy Method (v4)

If you are using v4, you can use the `onUpdate` method to listen for new content as it is generated.
Just don't forget to unsubscribe when you are done.

```ts
// ...

const unsubscribeUpdate = response.onUpdate((content) => {
    console.log(content);
});

const unsubscribeStop = response.onStreamingStop(() => {
    unsubscribeUpdate();
    unsubscribeStop();
});
```

> this method also works in v5, but `onContentStream` is preferred.
