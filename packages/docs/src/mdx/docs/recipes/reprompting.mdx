Just like on ChatGPT, you can edit previous user messages or reprompt the assistant for a specific message. 
When re-prompting, all messages **from** the re-prompted one will be removed from the conversation history.

```ts
import { Conversation } from "gpt-turbo";

const conversation = new Conversation({ config: { apiKey } });
const first = await conversation.prompt("We do not grant you the rank of Master."); // "How can you do this?!"
const second = await conversation.prompt("Take a seat, young Skywalker."); // "I will slaughter padawans!"
const edit = await conversation.reprompt(first, "We grant you the rank of Master.");
```
